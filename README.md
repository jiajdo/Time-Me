"Where does the time go??" is a question that many people ask themselves every day. Time Me is a web app that helps you track your time and what you're doing with it. 

Open the app, name your task, and start the timer. Stop the timer when you're done, and that task will be exported to your Google Calendar. See what you actually did with your days, weeks, and month. 

The gap between how you want to spend your time and how you actually spend it can be huge. Time Me helps you bridge that gap and take back control of your time.
